# MLOps Sentiment Text Analysis üöÄ

This project combines **Data Engineering** and **Data Science** workflows to build an end-to-end pipeline for sentiment analysis using **modern MLOps tools**. By leveraging **Dockerized microservices**, this system integrates **MLflow**, **MinIO**, **Apache Iceberg**, and **Apache Spark**, creating a scalable and efficient platform for processing, analyzing, and modeling sentiment datasets.

## üåü Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to process and analyze **sentiment datasets from Kaggle** through a robust pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Download datasets via the Kaggle API.
   - Store raw data as **Parquet files** in **MinIO** (an S3-compatible object storage).

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Add **new features** (e.g., word embeddings, text metadata) to the text data.
   - Save the transformed datasets into **Apache Iceberg tables** for efficient querying, updates, and machine learning workflows.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Train models to:
     - **Classify sentiment labels**.
     - Use **pretrained Spark NLP models from John Snow Labs** for advanced sentiment prediction tasks.
   - Track model performance and metadata using **MLflow**.
